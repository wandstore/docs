## ✍️ Copy Review: Landing Page v4

### Analysis of Current Copy

After reviewing the current landing page and studying Clerk.com's aesthetic, here's my assessment:

**Current Issues:**
1. **"Your Store Is Stuck in 2019"** — Feels slightly aggressive/dated as a framing device
2. **Small icon cards** (Lightning Fast, Context-Aware, Headless, Enterprise Ready) — These feel generic and don't match Clerk's clean, content-first approach
3. **Problem section with numbered cards** — The "01 Problem / 02 Problem / 03 Problem" pattern feels like filler content
4. **Features section** — "Everything You Need to Convert" with 3 icon cards is exactly the pattern we're trying to move away from

### 🎯 Optimized Copy (Clerk-Inspired)

#### HERO SECTION
**Current:** "Turn Every Visitor Into a Buyer"

**Optimized:**
> **A storefront that adapts to every visitor**
> 
> AI-generated experiences in under 100ms. No segments. No personas. Just individual moments that convert.

*Rationale: Clerk leads with the outcome, not the action. Cleaner, more confident.*

---

#### PROBLEM SECTION (Remove numbered cards entirely)
**Current:** "Your Store Is Stuck in 2019" + 3 icon cards

**Optimized:**
> **Static storefronts leave money on the table**
> 
> Your homepage shows the same products to a first-time visitor and your best customer. Same headlines. Same CTAs. Same missed opportunities.
> 
> The average e-commerce site loses 70% of visitors within 10 seconds.

*Rationale: Clerk doesn't use "problem" sections with cards. They lead with the solution. This version removes all small icon cards and focuses on a single, strong narrative.*

---

#### SOLUTION SECTION (Remove feature cards)
**Current:** "Meet the Storefront That Sells For You" + 4 icon cards

**Optimized:**
> **Generated for every visitor. Delivered at the edge.**
> 
> WandStore creates a unique storefront for each shopper — their device, location, time of day, and browsing history all shape what they see. Generated in under 100ms, anywhere in the world.
> 
> [Visual: Code snippet / API example showing the generation request]

*Rationale: Clerk uses code examples and technical credibility, not feature cards. The demo code snippet is more compelling than icons.*

---

#### PRICING SECTION
**Current:** "Agency Quality. 1/10th the Cost. Zero Wait."

**Optimized:**
> **Simple pricing, no surprises**

*Rationale: Clerk's pricing is clean and understated. The value prop should be evident from the product, not shouted in the headline.*

### 🗑️ What to Remove

1. **All small icon cards** — No more "Lightning Fast / Context-Aware / Headless / Enterprise Ready" grid
2. **Numbered problem cards** — Remove "01 Problem / 02 Problem / 03 Problem" pattern
3. **Feature grid** — Remove "Everything You Need to Convert" with 3 icon cards
4. **Live Activity widget** — Feels noisy compared to Clerk's calm confidence

### ✅ What to Keep

1. **Stats in hero** — "10x Conversion Lift / <100ms Generation / 200+ Brands" works well
2. **Pricing tiers** — Structure is good, just needs cleaner headline
3. **Trust badges** — "SOC 2 / 99.99% Uptime / 4.9/5" at bottom

### Design Notes for @felipejaner

- **More whitespace** — Clerk uses generous spacing between sections
- **Larger typography** — Hero should be bolder, section headers more prominent
- **Code snippets as visuals** — Replace icon cards with actual API examples or technical demos
- **Subtle color palette** — Clerk uses deep navy/blues with clean whites; consider similar premium tech aesthetic
- **Single-column narratives** — Instead of 3-column card grids, use full-width sections with strong copy

**Ready for design phase** 🎨
