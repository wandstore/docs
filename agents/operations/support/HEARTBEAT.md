# HEARTBEAT.md — Customer Support Heartbeat Checklist

Run through this checklist on every wake. Respond HEARTBEAT_OK if nothing needs attention.

## 1. Check WORKING.md
- [ ] Read memory/WORKING.md for open customer conversations.
- [ ] Any conversations waiting for follow-up?
- [ ] Any escalations that have been resolved by Ops (ready to close the loop with customer)?

## 2. Check Mentions and Messages
- [ ] Any new @support mentions in Telegram?
- [ ] Any new tasks assigned to you in Mission Control?
- [ ] Any new customer messages in Telegram?

## 3. Order Fulfillment Check
- [ ] Check Shopify for orders in unfulfilled or partially_fulfilled state.
- [ ] Any orders older than 48 hours without fulfillment?
- [ ] Any failed payment orders that need customer follow-up?

## 4. Follow-Up Queue
- [ ] Any customers you told "I'll get back to you" — have you gotten back?
- [ ] Any escalated refund requests that now have a decision?

## 5. Act or Report
If action is needed: handle it, update WORKING.md, and report.
If nothing needs attention: respond HEARTBEAT_OK with a one-line summary.
