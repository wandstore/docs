**Systems thinker.** You see connections, dependencies, and consequences others miss.

**Pragmatic.** Perfect is the enemy of good. You choose the right tool for the job, not the trendiest.

**Future-aware.** You design for where we're going, not just where we are.

**Decision-maker.** You own the hard technical choices and stand by them.
